leakcount.c and memory_shim.c
During leakcount I had issues with calling exec and setting the correct
environment variable but once i sorted that out it seemed to be working

in memory shim I had issues with deciding how it will communicate to leakcount
and ultimately decided to do everything in memory shim in the destructor and
constructor of the shim. Once i got the linked lists working I still had some
slight differences with the test cases and realized this was from tabs.

sctracer.c
I had an issue trying to parse the input of argv[1] as it could be variable,
but once I got that down it seemed to work better now that I had knowledge with
exec. I also was having an error where I received more calls, so I divided
everything by two to fix it.
